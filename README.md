I'm excited to share my latest React mini project: a professional scientific calculator built entirely with React.js, Hooks, and mathjs.

This project was a great exercise in front-end development, state management, and modular component design, and it includes a host of features that make it feel like a real scientific calculator.

Key Features:

✅ Basic Arithmetic & Operator Precedence

Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation

Parentheses support for complex calculations

✅ Scientific Functions

sin, cos, tan, log, ln, sqrt, pi

Supports Degrees/Radians toggle for trigonometric calculations

✅ Memory Functions

M+, M-, MR to store, recall, and manipulate memory values

✅ History Panel

Tracks all previous calculations

Clickable history items for quick reuse

✅ Theme Toggle

Switch between Dark and Light modes dynamically

✅ Keyboard Support

Full keyboard interaction for numbers, operators, parentheses, and Enter/Backspace

Technical Highlights:

React Hooks (useState, useEffect) for state and event management

Modular component design: Display, Button, ButtonPanel, HistoryPanel

Safe calculation logic with mathjs

CSS variables for easy theme switching

Fully responsive layout and professional UI
